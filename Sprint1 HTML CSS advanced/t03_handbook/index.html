          <h3>IP</h3> 
          <p id="description">
            To determine an IP address, you can follow these steps:
            <br><br>
            Open a command prompt on your computer.
            Type "ipconfig" and press Enter.
            Look for the "IPv4 Address" line under the network adapter you're currently using. This will display the IP address of your computer on that network.
            Alternatively, you can visit a website that will display your public IP address, such as "whatismyip.com" or "ipchicken.com". These websites will show you the public IP address.

          <h3>DNS</h3> 
          <p id="description">
            DNS records are used to translate domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate servers on the internet. Here is a brief description of some common DNS record types:
            <br><br>
            A Record: This is the most common type of DNS record, and it maps a domain name to an IP address.
            <br><br>
            AAAA Record: Similar to A records, but used for IPv6 addresses.
            <br><br>
            MX Record: This record maps a domain name to the mail exchange servers that are responsible for handling email messages sent to that domain.
            <br><br>
            CNAME Record: This is an alias record that maps one domain name to another. It is often used for subdomains or to create a shorter, easier-to-remember URL.
            <br><br>
            TXT Record: This record can contain any arbitrary text and is often used for verification or authentication purposes.
            <br><br>
            SRV Record: This record is used to specify the location of a service on a domain, such as a specific port for a particular protocol.
            <br><br>
            NS Record: This record specifies the authoritative name servers for a domain.
            <br><br>
            These are just a basic of the many types of DNS records that exist. Each record type serves a specific purpose in the DNS system.

          <h3>HTTP methods</h3> 
          <p id="description">
            HTTP methods are used to indicate the action to be performed on a resource identified by a URI. Here's a description of each HTTP method:
            <br><br>
            GET: Requests a representation of a resource. It retrieves information from the server without changing the state of the resource.
            <br><br>  
            POST: Submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
            <br><br>
              PUT: Replaces the entity of the specified resource with the new one provided in the request payload.
            <br><br>
            DELETE: Deletes the specified resource.
            <br><br>
            HEAD: Requests the header of a resource, without retrieving the actual representation of the resource.
            <br><br>
            OPTIONS: Requests information about the communication options available for the specified resource.
            <br><br>
            CONNECT: Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel.
            <br><br>
            TRACE: Echoes back the received request, allowing clients to see what intermediate servers are changing or adding to the request.
            <br><br>
            PATCH: Partially modifies the specified resource by applying a set of changes specified in the request payload.
        </div>

          <h3>HTTP status codes</h3> 
          <p id="description">
            HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server to indicate the status of a client's request. Here are some common HTTP status codes and their meanings:
            <br><br>
            200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.
            <br>
            201 Created: The server has successfully created a new resource.
            <br>
            204 No Content: The server has fulfilled the request, but there is no new information to send back.
            <br><br>
            400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
            <br>
            401 Unauthorized: The client does not have proper authentication credentials for the resource.
            <br>
            403 Forbidden: The client is authenticated, but does not have access to the requested resource.
            <br>
            404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested resource.
            <br><br>
            500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error while processing the request.
            <br>
            503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unavailable due to maintenance or overload.

After being stored for an unknown amount of time on a pedestal in Kamar-Taj, it was recently wielded by Doctor Stephen Strange, first to aid him in his learning of sorcery, then in his final fight against Kaecilius and Dormammu. </td>

                    <td>The Scepter was a weapon that utilized the yellow Mind Stone housed inside a blue computer module, which also masked the stone's presence.
                         Stark originally saw the Stone as a power source, whereas once J.A.R.V.I.S. 
                         had the opportunity to study the stone he stated it was more akin to a very powerful computer. 
                         The stone within had already been in the possession of Thanos when he gave it to Loki to aid him in his invasion of Earth. 
                         It grants to the user powerful mental abilities, like the power to subjugate the minds of others, bending them to the will of the user,
                          as well as project the user's consciousness to a higher plane of existence.</td>

                        providing the user instant access to any location throughout the universe if used correctly.
                         The unique element that composes the Tesseract has also been used to create advanced weaponry by races like the Humans. 
                         This stone played an important role in humanity's development during the dawn of the superhero age, attracting the attention of forces such as Red Skull and Thanos, both of whom sought to use the Tesseract's power for their own sinister intents. 
                         It is later revealed that the cube is a containment unit built around the actual Infinity Stone so that it could be somewhat safely handled and controlled. </td>
